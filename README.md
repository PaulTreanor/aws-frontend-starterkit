# AWS Frontend Starterkit

This is a starterkit to help deploy frontend applications to AWS. It includes some of the DX bells and whistles that managed services like Vercel offer, but with more control and less risk of enormous unexpected bills. 


## Overview 
The **frontend-app** directory contains a React/Vite application. 

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap 
**Must haves**

1. Basic website hosting with S3
2. Set up the CDN with Cloudfront 
3. Integrate that with a custom domain name
4. Integrate a CDCD pipeline with GitHub Actions (should work on main branch)

**Nice to haves**

5. Instant rollbacks
6. Preview deployments
7. Some sort of dashboard 
8. Cost monitoring/observability
